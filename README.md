Machine learning is a field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and techniques that enable computers to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions from data, without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used techniques in machine learning for predictive modeling and statistical analysis.

Linear regression is considered a supervised learning algorithm, which means it learns from labeled data. In the context of linear regression, labeled data consists of input features (independent variables) and corresponding output labels (dependent variable). The goal is to learn a model that can predict the output labels based on the input features.

Linear regression is used for various tasks in machine learning, including:

Predicting continuous outcomes based on one or more input variables.
Understanding relationships between variables.
Estimating the impact of individual predictors on the outcome variable.
Assessing the significance of predictors in explaining variability in the outcome variable.
